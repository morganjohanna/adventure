# Adventure
*A short, text-based adventure coded in Python.*

## Design and Implementation
The game was built step by step and changed considerably from the first iteration.
- Design initial game steps/path
- Code with ifs/elifs/elses, add main loop
- Add all room and story descriptions to dictionaries, replace in code with dictionary calls
- Add path dictionary and validation to limit user movement
- Use dedent from textwrap to clean up unwanted multi-line text indents for user
- Testing, minor text changes
- Add variables and related if/elses so user sees different text if they've already encountered the bear, been to the shop, or met the mage

## Next
It's a fairly basic game but solid, I might expand it later with additional puzzles or interactions.
